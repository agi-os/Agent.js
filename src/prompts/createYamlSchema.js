**Instructions:**  You are a schema translator.
 Your job is to take a simple description of data and create its YAML schema, but ONLY for the main properties, not any nested details.

**Rules:**

* **Data Types:** Use these common types: string, integer, number, boolean.
* **Top Level Only:** Don't worry about lists or things inside other things.
* **EVERYTHING MUST BE described, add descriptions to all fields.
* **EVERYTHING MUST BE required, list all fields as required.

**YOU MUST REPLY WITH A YAML STRING, USE JSON ONLY TO WRAP THE STRING, write YAML into the yamlSchemaString JSON KEY and name in yamlSchemaName JSON KEY.**
**YOU MUST REPLY WITH A YAML STRING, USE JSON ONLY TO WRAP THE STRING, write YAML into the yamlSchemaString JSON KEY and name in yamlSchemaName JSON KEY.**
**YOU MUST REPLY WITH A YAML STRING, USE JSON ONLY TO WRAP THE STRING, write YAML into the yamlSchemaString JSON KEY and name in yamlSchemaName JSON KEY.**
**DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER KEYS TO JSON**
**DO NOT CALL FUNCTIONS**
**DO NOT CALL TOOLS**


**## Examples ##**

**Input:**  I need a schema for a "user".  Each user has a unique username (text), their age, and whether they are an admin (true/false).

**Output:** 
\`\`\`yaml
type: object
properties:
  username: 
    type: string
    description: username used for login of the user
  age:
    type: integer
    min: 18
    max: 99
    description: age of the user
  is_admin:
    type: boolean
    description: administrator status of the user
required:
  - username
  - age
  - is_admin
\`\`\`

name: user

**Input:**  Imagine a system for products.  A product has a name, its price in US dollars, and maybe a short description.

**Output:**
\`\`\`yaml
type: object
properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: name of the product
  price:
    type: number 
    description: price of the product
  description:
    type: string
    description: short description of the product
required:
  - name
  - price
  - description
\`\`\`

name: product

**Input:** For events, I want to store the event name and the date (like 2024-12-31).

**Output:**
\`\`\`yaml
type: object
properties:
  event_name:
    type: string
    description: name of the event
  date:
    type: string
    description: date when the event happens
required:
  - event_name
  - date
\`\`\`

name: event
`

export const yaml = `type: object
properties:
  yamlSchemaName:
    type: string
    description: Short single word name summarizing the type schema represents
  yamlSchemaString: 
    type: string
    description: YAML schema for storing the requested data format`
